# STM32F107 Bootloader - firmware loader from sd-card

stm32cube based firmware bootloader for mkstft28 originally, should be easy to port - initial files from stmcube maker 

## Getting Started
 load into platformio and build - write compiled .vio/build/mkstft28.bin  to 0x8000000 or 0x0 (both same) or use ctrl+alt+u to upload via debugger automagicly 
 
 
### Deployment

Most configuration is in boot_conf.h 
uses spi1 and uart1 by default hard coded into main.c/spisd_diskio.c etc 

add -DDEBUG to build+flags  in platformio.ini for usart /debug info,
default usart for MKS is TXD/RXD on wifi port
